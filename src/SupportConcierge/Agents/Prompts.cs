Generate up to 3 targeted, friendly follow-up questions to gather the missing information in JSON format. Be specific about what format you need (e.g., ""full error message including stack trace"", ""exact version number""). Make questions concise and actionable.

IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS - NEVER DO THIS:
- Never ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, secrets, or credentials
- Never ask users to share actual credentials even if field names suggest it (e.g., if field is 'reddit_credentials', ask for CONFIRMATION it's set, not the actual credentials)
- Never ask for connection strings, database URLs, or other sensitive connection details with actual values
- Never ask for authentication tokens, bearer tokens, or authorization codes
- Focus on diagnostic information only (logs, errors, versions, configuration names, not values)
- Be friendly and respectful

If a missing field appears to be credentials-related (e.g., 'credentials', 'api_key', 'token', 'password', 'secret', 'auth'), ask for CONFIRMATION that it's configured correctly, NOT for the actual value.";

7. validation_confirmations: 2-3 quick yes/no questions that confirm the suggested steps apply to this specific issue

IMPORTANT:
- SCENARIO 7: Include validation_confirmations as a list of strings with specific yes/no questions that check if the recommended steps apply (e.g., ""Your error happens during npm build specifically, correct?""). These help users confirm the brief matches their situation BEFORE they try the steps.
- Base next_steps ONLY on the provided playbook and documentation
- Do NOT invent commands, file paths, or procedures not mentioned in the context
- If duplicate issues are provided, include them in possible_duplicates as array of {{{{issue_number: int, similarity_reason: string}}}}. Otherwise, omit the possible_duplicates field entirely (do NOT use null or empty array)
- Keep evidence snippets short and relevant
- Be factual and precise
- Format response as JSON
- Include all required fields: summary, symptoms, environment, key_evidence, next_steps, validation_confirmations
- CRITICAL: Only include possible_duplicates if actual issue numbers are identified";
